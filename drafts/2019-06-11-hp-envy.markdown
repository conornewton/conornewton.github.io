# Arch Linux on a HP-Envy 13-ah0003na

### This is a work in progress!
This is my current knowledge of running arch linux of my HP-Envy 13.

Any innaccuracies or questions drop me a message at conor@conornewton.uk

The following works out of the box:

* WIFI
* Touchpad (libinput driver works fine)
* Webcam Micro SD card reader
* USB-3 
* USB-C (USB-C to HDMI also works)

## The following I can get working with a few steps:

### Bluetooth

I installed the packages *bluez* and *bluez-util*. Then I had to enable bluetooth service with systemctl as follows. 

```
# pacman -S bluez, bluez-util
# systemctl enable bluetooth.service

```

The drivers packaged with the kernel work fine.

### Graphics

Graphics is fairly complicated. Take a look at the [nvidia optimus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA_Optimus) article on the arch wiki. I need to play with this a bit more.

## I have not managed to get the following completely working:

### Touchscreen

The touchscreen does not work out of the box, I have yet to get this to work.

### Sound 

After installing pulse audio and unmuting the master channel the sound works out of the left and right speakers but not the central one.
