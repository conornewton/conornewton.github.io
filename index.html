<p>I am a mathematics student at the University of Bristol. I like pure mathematics and programming. I made this site using <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">hakyll</a>! You can find the source code of this site <a href="https://github.com/conornewton/conornewton.github.io/tree/develop"> here </a></p>

<p>I am graduating in summer 2020 with an MSci Mathematics and I am interested in all opportunities related to mathematics or programming. Here is my <a href="https://github.com/conornewton/cv/raw/master/cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
