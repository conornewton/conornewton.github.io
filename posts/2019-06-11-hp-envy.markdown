# Linux on a HP-Envy 13-ah0003na

The following are my results of using arch linux. I will continuously update this to reflect my current understanding.

Any innaccuracies or questions drop me a message at conor@conornewton.uk

The following works out of the box fine:

* WIFI
* Touchpad (libinput driver works fine)
* Webcam
* Micro SD card reader
* USB3 (I have not tested this with HDMI adapters and etc. But I believe it would work fine.)

## Bluetooth

I installed the packages *bluez* and *bluez-util*. Then I had to enable bluetooth service with systemctl as follows. The drivers packaged with the kernel work fine.

## Graphics

Graphics is fairly complicated. Take a look at the nvidia optimus article on the arch wiki. I need to play with this a bit more.

## Touchscreen

The touchscreen does not work out of the box, i have yet to get this to work.

## Sound 

After installing pulse audio and unmuting the master channel the sound works out of the left and right speakers but the central one.

## Fingerprint Scanner

Works fine after installing the package libfinput. I'm not sure how much i will use this.
